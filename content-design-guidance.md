## Digital content design

This guide is designed to share understanding about what needs to happen before, during, and after a project to ensure the construction and maintenance of great content.

It is based on the most common tasks we do: redesigning an existing service and creating new content.

1.	**Assess the brief**

Content is often thought of as an add-on to a project – something that comes midway or at the end of a project. Key decisions about content need to be made at the very start: what kind of questions you ask users, where the content they’re already familiar with is located, information architecture, logging key search terms. Check that the hypothesis is watertight.

At this stage, ask the following: 
Make sure the thing being discussed is an idea or a problem. 
*	What does the user need to do or find out from us? 
*	Where did the proposal come from? Letting projects arrive as solutions, or half-started, often causes issues for us later, so as a wider team we must always work with the stakeholder and team to break it back down into an idea or a problem. 
*	Is there a validated user/audience need/business case for this content?
*	How can it add value? 
*	Does the proposed thing already exist elsewhere, and are we best-placed to produce it, because this will of course affect SEO and how it’s found. 
*	What is the impact or intended impact of implementing the idea or changes and how has that been evidenced? 
*	What would happen if this work didn’t happen? 
*	Does this service/idea affect or alter any of our other products, or will it be resolved by a bigger project in the future? 

Who is in the project team? Which business owner, content owner, delivery manager, developers and user researchers will you be working with?

2. **Explore**

Once a brief has been delivered, the whole team will ideally be doing an Explore phase. At this stage, editors will be exploring the following:

*	Information audit/content mapping.
o	If it’s new content, does the user feedback suggest the users envisage this content in the way we do? 
o	If it’s a redesign, what content exists already and where does it sit? 
*	Top user tasks
o	Find out what users want to do, why, what problems they encounter, how they feel about the process, and the terms they are using. 
o	Map out the key tasks we might be asking users to do and how long it takes them. 
o	Use metrics and user research to establish the top tasks and order them to help declutter/remove unhelpful content.
o	Scope the user journey: Where does a user meet the content? It may not be at the website - it might be through a phone call to the contact centre - we need to find out what their first port of contact is and why they’re calling as opposed to using the website.
*	Technical architecture
o	For existing content: how is it appearing (for example, through an XML file)?
o	For new content: what technical architecture is in scope for us to work with?

3. **Develop content**
Now you should have a sense of what needs to happen and what it might entail within the scope of the project.
*	Understand what content is required. 
*	When and where are you designing content that meets MVP? 
*	Define what you will and won’t tackle within this timeframe, and how you’ll backlog anything you encounter (especially if it might affect other projects).
*	Understand the ‘content lifecycle’. 
*	If it entails additional work the content owners hadn’t considered, would they still they still want to commission the project? In the case of the Black British History portal, for the project to remain effective, people need to continue tagging blogs or podcasts linked to black history. These things need to be assessed and agreed in advance. 
*	Remember that content on our website needs to be kept as public record - if it’s no longer current it goes in the web archive. 
*	Content needs to be kept up to date - what does this work look like and who is owning this work?
*	Define a working project methodology and tools for the editorial process. 
*	Establish which form of communication you will need to use to report to the project team to pull work and to update them on your progress. 
*	Understand how to break up editorial work into sizeable tasks that fit the Agile approach, ie move across the board from ‘in progress’ to ‘done.’ 
*	If you are also the project/delivery lead, think about how you are going to lead the team as well as complete the editorial tasks, and consider delegating. 
*	Develop a workflow for content development and document it.
* If you are creating the content, establish who to get sign off from, how you will provide content to them, and an editorial-development workflow. 
*	If a content owner is creating the content, establish what they are writing, how they are supplying it to you, what tone you have decided on, and the process for sign-off.
*	Do you need a second opinion/content crit? 
*	Develop a means of delivering the content from the back-end
*	How will you deliver this content from the content management system?
*	Work with the developer to ensure the backend for the content owner is easy to access and use, ie design content for templates, integrate error messages, etc
*	Information architecture: Working with UX, establish where this content might sit, what format it might take, the places it is served to, and how the IA will be validated.
*	Establish a glossary of terminology.
*	 Is this glossary understandable by the user? 
*	Do we use that term across the site? 
*	Are there particular rules that might apply to how we use it?
*	Who signs off on this glossary? Eg, business owner 

4. **Prototype content**
This is the stage at which you translate content to a wireframe or digital prototype. It’s where the copy meets the design so it should be a highly iterative process and should involve a lot of collaboration with designer/developers and user experience researchers.

*	**Create paper/wireframe prototypes**
*	Working with a developer, understand the arrangement of content, eg Menu button, footer, any buttons on each screen involved in the service. Sketch paper prototypes.
*	...then create digital prototypes
*	This is a more detailed prototype than a paper wireframe, as you are now filling in the full content that appears. 
*	Which format will you use to prototype, eg, paper, HTML?
*	Work with the user researchers to establish when and how you will validate the user experience of this prototype - will you show it to users and how will you do it in a format that they will understand? 
*	Establish a working method with the designer/developer - what format do they want your content in to transfer it to the prototype, and how do they want your changes?

-------User testing happens----------------------------------------------------

5. **Validate the prototype** 
The prototype will now enter user testing to be validated. This can be a quieter stage of the project for editors, but you can still get involved by sitting in on user testing sessions so you can directly see how the prototype is being received, taking notes that the user researchers can cross-reference with their own and proofreading any surveys they will be sending out.

*	Translate user feedback to editorial changes. Work with the user researcher to understand what pieces of user feedback are significant enough to act on editorially. Can these changes be made while still achieving the MVP? If they can’t is it worth putting them into a backlog and coming back to them in another iteration? 
*	If there are changes to be made, proceed to Step 4 (Prototype content) again.
*	If there are no changes to be made, proceed to Step 6.

6. **Contribute to functional development**  
Establish with the developer how the prototype will be developed into a functional product. If something is being developed in Wordpress, you will need to contribute to the template design in Wordpress to ensure usability from an editorial and authorial point of view. 

*	Confirm content in functional design. Ensure that the content from the prototype has been taken across accurately into the functional product. If it hasn’t, establish a workflow for feeding in corrections.
*	Contribute to template design  

It’s not only the public that are users - staff inside the building who own and maintain the content (including us editors!) are users too, so we need to make the backend (WordPress) interfaces as intuitive and user friendly as possible. Having input into how a form confirmation email, for example, is built into the Wordpress template is important. Establish with a developer at what point they will be thinking about how to build the template, and how you can help contribute. Also think of who else in the organisation will be using this template, eg CEE Editorial/content owners in other teams, and how you can get them in front of this template to test how usable it is.
If something isn’t being developed in Wordpress or a system that you work in regularly, establish a means of working with the backend/front end developer to ensure editorial changes are integrated appropriately.
*	Testing. 
*	Local testing with the developer. Once the functional design has been built, sit with the developer to test how it works in the local DEV environment.
*	TEST testing - once confirmed, the design will then be put into a TEST environment that should mimic the LIVE environment as closely as possible, so you can test the feature on your own machine. This involves trying to ‘break’ the back-end to identify any bugs or errors in code, as the local DEV environment can be quite different to TEST. Establish a workflow to feed back errors to the developer. This might involve the developer creating a list of testing questions for you.

7. **Obtain sign-off**     
Now that the product is in a state where it could be ready for the LIVE environment, it needs to be signed-off by business owners, product owners and the project team.  

8. **PREPARING FOR BETA/LIVE** 
The product must remain in TEST until the following points have been completed:
	Compile redirects. Using the content mapping done earlier in the project, identify all the links to the content, and within the content and what they will need to be redirected to. This spreadsheet can go through Webmaster/Angela to IT.
*	Identify content that needs to be deleted/updated in the context of the new content.
*	Work with the user researcher to establish whether there will there be a means of collecting user feedback on the product while it is LIVE, eg surveys? Help develop any content that needs to accompany promotion of this survey.
*	Internal Comms may need to be involved in establishing a communications plan to the internal stakeholders that includes the latest version of the content, and a BETA/Go Live date
*	Marketing may need to be involved in establishing whether there needs to be external communications and what will this look like and entail?
*	Ensure any documentation is completed and accessible through Objective/editorial.livelb/Narnia/Slack/Trello/Github, eg training guidance, guidance for editors, style/design guide updates, stakeholder emails, PIAs
*	Have content owners been trained sufficiently?
*	Before publishing any links to something that’s just been put onto the LIVE environment, check that it is working as expected   

8a. **Beta-live stage**
What does BETA look like? If the product you are creating is replacing an old one, will the old content still be live side-by-side with the newly launched version or will the new version supercede? Have redirects been considered if so? Create a Beta plan.
* How is Beta being promoted? Messages about Beta typically appear in a notification banner at the top of every page in the new product.
*	Is feedback being collected? Is there a survey to accompany the Beta message? How will you entice people to complete it? How long will it be advertised for? 
*How will feedback be implemented? What is the internal feedback mechanism, eg feedback-UX-content-dev-internal? What constitutes implementing feedback, ie scope, timeframes?
*	Is iteration actively occurring? and are there resources for it to occur during this stage? If not, how are the feedback-generated issues being recorded for backlogging purposes?

8b. **LIVE**
*	Are redirects working?
*	Has old content been removed/updated?
*	Has BETA messaging been removed/updated?
*	Do URLs make sense?
*	Product maintenance plan implementation - do the content owners know how to maintain their content and have a clear understanding that we are handing over the product to them?

9. **Post-live**  
As Trisha Doyle, Head of Content Deisgn at GDS, puts it: “Post transformation is harder than the transformation itself”. The working culture after a redesign or new product launch is hard to change. Make sure the work doesn’t stop at release. Keep in touch with stakeholders to garner feedback incoming after launch, any teething issues or blockers of the new process. Often, more training needs to be done. Any new work, however, needs to be fed through the appropriate channels.
