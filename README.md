# tna-delivery-toolkit
 Documentation and tools to help in delivery new initiatives (suitable for product, service or project delivery)  

## Introduction  
This repository provides several resources to help the Delivery Teams at The National Archives to:  

1.	streamline delivery process and resolve blockers
2.	build-in quality by revising definition of done and checklist 
3.	achieving a good balance between team autonomy and effective use of our delivery flow
4.	help with governance and decision-making progress

It is a living, open tool to which all can contribute and is regularly reviewed and refined to ensure it reflects emerging industry best practice. We welcome any and all feedback to be submitted either as a pull request or issue.
