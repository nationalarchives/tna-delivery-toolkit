Documentation and tools to help in product or project delivery  

Introduction  
This repository provides several resources to help the Delivery Teams at The National Archives to:  

1.	streamline delivery process and resolve blockers
2.	build-in quality by revising definition of done and checklist 
3.	achieving a good balance between team autonomy and effective use of our delivery flow
